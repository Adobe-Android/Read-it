# Read-it
A book review app re-imagined in the style of Reddit.

- Have you ever had a friend recommend a book and then you forgot about it entirely?
- Have you ever just wanted to keep track of all the different books you are currently reading?
The book review process can also be complicated and hard to parse through.
That's why we streamlined it with some ideas from our friends at Reddit!
You either recommend the book or you don't with a simple upvote or downvote.
From there, you can also leave an official review.

## Future Plans
In the future..we plan to add a few extra features.
1. Fix the front-end toggle on upvoting/downvoting to reflect the database value (we are already doing this right server-side, but that isn't made perfectly clear.
2. Attach reviews from any user to the books on search or maybe make a separate view that does this.
3. Make a visible count available to the user that will change with each upvote and downvote
4. Add some extra polish by making deleted and added content automatically appear.
